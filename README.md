# The-asymmetric-inflation-dynamics-in-LATAM-Evidence-from-a-quantile-regression-approach

This repository provides the data used in Aguilar, Quineche, and Garibay (2025), “The Asymmetric Inflation Dynamics in LATAM: Evidence from a Quantile Regression Approach.”

a) The file data.xlsx contains the price indices for Peru, Chile, and Colombia, obtained from official statistical sources. The deviations of the year-over-year percentage change in these indices from 2 percent (Peru) and 3 percent (Chile and Colombia) are presented in Figure 1.

b) The file data_sa.xlsx includes the seasonally adjusted indices for Peru, Chile, and Colombia, processed using the TRAMO-SEATS method. From these indices, annualized monthly percentage changes are computed and used to construct Tables 1–5, A.1–A.2, as well as Figures 2, B.1, and B.2.
